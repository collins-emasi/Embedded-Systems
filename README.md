# 8051 Microcontroller Embedded Systems
This repository contains code and documentation for projects that use the 8051 microcontroller in embedded systems. The 8051 is an old but versatile microcontroller that is still widely used in many applications.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
To work with the code in this repository, you will need the following software:

- A compiler that can generate 8051 assembly code (such as SDCC or Keil uVision)
- An 8051-compatible programmer (such as the USB 8051 programmer)
- A software for serial communication and terminal emulation (such as Realterm or PuTTY)

## Setting up the development environment
1. Install the required software on your computer.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Connect the 8051 programmer to your computer and to the 8051 microcontroller on your board.
4. Open the project file in the compiler and build the project.
5. Use the programmer to upload the hex file to the microcontroller.
### _Alternatively you can use the Proteus simulation software as I did_

## Testing
Once the code is uploaded to the microcontroller, you can use the serial communication software to interact with the microcontroller.

## Project Examples
Here are some examples of projects that can be built with this codebase:

- `Blinking LED`: This basic project involves controlling the output of an LED connected to a specific pin of the microcontroller.
- `UART communication`: This project demonstrates how to set up serial communication with a PC using the UART module of the microcontroller.
- `Interrupt-based button debouncing`: This project shows how to use interrupts to debounce the input of a button connected to the microcontroller.
